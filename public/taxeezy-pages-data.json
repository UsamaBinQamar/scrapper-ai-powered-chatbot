        "Having developed a unique system for simplified tax information gathering, combined with simultaneous support, we have now been trading online successfully for more than ten years. Taxeezy was formed from a combination of over 100 years practical experience in the following fields",
        "Taxeezy was formed in recognition of the fact that an increasing amount of people are carrying out the completion of their tax return online. While this is catered for on the official government site, it was considered that this was lacking in the essential area of support for the individual in respect of their particular circumstances.",
        "It stands to reason that an enormous government department cannot possibly apply this level of personal support and it was considered that, for a modest fee, which in most cases is more than recoverable in savings by the application of expertise, the whole process could be simplified and made more pleasant by the removal of the red tape that accompanies the official experience. The other option, of course, is the High Street accountant with associated High Street fees.",
        "In the matter-of-fact issue of the preparation and completing of tax returns, there really is no better way of catering for the needs of all. It is this combined experience and team application that provides the very best support for the individual, as, whatever their occupation, or employment status Taxeezy can relate to the practical issues involved.",
        "Support is the cornerstone of any service and when you engage Taxeezy you receive as would be expected from a long-term tried and tested operation. We are the original and the best – beware of imitations!",

        "Complete your NRL Scheme application in a few easy steps.",
        "Letting agents (or tenants) of a non-resident landlord must deduct tax from the landlord’s UK rental income and pay the tax to HMRC via the Non-Resident Landlord Scheme.",
        "This normally bypasses the need for a UK tax return concerning the property income, subject to the discretion of HMRC, however, it can also be very tax inefficient; personal allowance and certain letting expenses will not be accounted for in the calculation of profit.",
        "If you want to receive your rental income with no tax deducted, you can apply to HMRC for exemption from deduction of tax at source.  HMRC will instruct your letting agent (or tenant) to stop deducting tax at source and register you for self-assessment (if not already registered).  You can then report your property income on your UK tax return.  By filing a UK tax return, you pay tax only on your net rental profits and you can claim all available allowances and tax reliefs.",
        "If you are resident abroad and, for some reason, your letting agent (or tenant) is not deducting tax at source from rental income, then you must apply regardless and this is relevant to both UK and Foreign Nationals.",
        "Log in, have a look around, check out the services we offer.",
        "You provide us with some basic information and we’ll have everything we need to start preparing your NRL1i Application."
