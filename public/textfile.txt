### 60 Day CGT Report
Taxeezy assists clients with 60 Day Capital Gains Tax (CGT) Reports. HMRC requires taxpayers to report and pay any tax due on a disposal of UK Land and Property within 60 days of completion. These reports are filed using HMRC's Capital Gains Tax on UK property Account, a standalone digital service. The requirement to file varies based on residency status at the time of disposal, with different rules for UK residents versus non-residents. Taxeezy helps clients accurately report and manage their capital gains tax obligations, minimize tax liability, and remain compliant with relevant tax regulations.
